MySQL Load Balancer
Often, web applications lack the ability for multiple MySQL servers to be used.So, this project is an effort to create
a PHP class that could be implemented in many PHP applications without or with slight modification.
It uses a text file for storing data about whether the system has to fall back on backup server or not.
This will prevent data loss until the main server is live again and well synchronised.After falling to backup server,the status.txt should be removed. 

Using on Wordpress:
Place balancer.inc.php on root directory and use the sample wp-config provided.

Implemented:
Primary and Backup server

TODO:
Create sample configs for popular CMSes and blogging platforms.
Round-Robin Configuration
Priority Based Selection

Use at your own risk.
