## This repository is just here for historical purpose where I can see what I aimed just after learning small amount of PHP.

~~MySQL Load Balancer
Often, web applications lack the ability for multiple MySQL servers to be used.So,this project is an effort to create
a PHP class that could be implemented in many PHP applications without or with slight modification.~~
~~It uses a text file for storing data about whether the system has to fall back on backup server or not.~~

~~This will prevent data loss until the main server is live again and well synchronised.After falling to backup server,the status.txt should be removed.~~

~~Using on Wordpress(Don't):
Place balancer.inc.php on root directory and use the sample wp-config provided.~~

~~Implemented:
Primary and Backup server~~

~~TODO:
Create sample configs for popular CMSes and blogging platforms.
Round-Robin Configuration
Priority Based Selection
Email and Alerting~~

~~Use at your own risk.~~
